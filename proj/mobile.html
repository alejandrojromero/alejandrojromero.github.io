                        <p class="proj-body"> I have always loved video games. They're the main reason I fell in love
                            with creating
                            experiences for users. However, a lot of my experience before joining Blizzard involved more
                            self-contained
                            experimental projects, so I was extremely excited to get the opportunity to
                            <strong>spearhead design on two new features for a product reaching
                                millions of gamers.</strong>
                        </p>

                        <p class="proj-body"> During my internship, <strong>I worked on the Battle.net mobile
                                app</strong>,
                            a hub for players to
                            socialize while playing Activision-Blizzard games, learn more about their favorite games,
                            get customer
                            support, and more.
                        </p>
                        <p class="proj-body space-bottom"> Specifically, my mentor gave me a very open-ended problem:
                            <strong>the Battle.net
                                mobile app currently has robust social features, but is lacking in player utility
                                features.</strong>
                            The team had just launched a Forums tab on the app, which had driven greater user
                            engagement. I wanted to design features that could improve both user acquisition and
                            retention while enhancing the overall experience for users, so I did an informal competitive
                            analysis and thought about what features I like
                            (or would like!) in existing gaming
                            companion apps. <strong>I worked on two new utility features: News and Game
                                Library.</strong>

                            team and started to learn the lay of the land. I was blown away by the meticulous design
                            systems in place, but was surprised to learn that <strong>my team had no system in place for
                                creating wireframes.</strong>
                        </p>
                        <p class="proj-body space-bottom"> I started my design explorations for the News feature by
                            creating some wireframes, which
                            proved to be immensly effective during high-level discussions with engineers and PMs.
                            Because of the increased efficiency in
                            meetings and conveying design thinking to expedite the development pipeline, I created a
                            Wireframe Design System for the team.

                        <p class="proj-body space-bottom"> In the wires themselves, I was experimenting with 3 potential
                            directions for delivering News to users:
                            filtering news by game, aggregating all news into a single feed, and embedding news on
                            individual game paged nested within the game library. After a few <strong>feedback sessions
                                with engineers, designers, and PMs on my team and beyond</strong>, it soon became clear
                            that this third option would
                            impair access to the feature. The option for aggregating all news, though
                            cheap to develop,
                            would come at the cost of user frustration with a lack of content control. So I decided to
                            iterate on the game filtering user flow.

                            gathering feedback as I went. I worked with the Content UI team to discuss the most
                            efficient and elegant
                            ways to bring News into the app. <strong>Setting up meetings with engineers and PMs on

                            that collaboration and communication are especially crucial early on in the design process.

                            hi-fi design feedback from the entire design org, prototype critiques, and user story
                            mapping with
                            my team. Story mapping was especially insightful, as it<strong> allowed us to create an
                                affinity map of potential
                                directions to pursue based on the many different perspectives of our team

                            interactions with a feature. Mapping the user journey not only helped me think about new

                            but prompted me to consider if there were any gaps in the user flow that needed to be

                            in which I accounted for more than just the core interactions: scroll states, loading

                            error screens, etc. had to be considered for implementation.

                        <p class="proj-body">My time at Blizzard was incredibly fun and helped me grow exponentially as
                            a designer.
                            I learned from some of the best UX designers I've ever met, and felt welcomed and included
                            throughout the
                            entire process.
                        </p>
                        <ul class="proj-body">
                            <li><strong>Adversity can help you grow /</strong> During the summer of my internship, many
                                ethical
                                issues arose at Blizzard. Advocating for inclusion and change alongside my teammates
                                helped remind me
                                that staying true to your values can help you through difficult times. The openness and
                                support
                                provided by my team demonstrated that helping others is at the center of what we do as
                                creators.
                            </li>

                            <li><strong>Gather feedback from anyone who'll provide it /</strong> After my first few
                                weeks,
                                the main actionable feedback I received was that I could be more proactive in reaching
                                out to others.
                                I hadn't realized it, but setting up meetings with other teams, casual 1:1s with new
                                faces, and general feedback
                                sessions was highly encouraged. So I took initiative and tried to speak to as many
                                coworkers as possible, whether
                                to gather design feedback or simply to learn more about them as people.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Focus on the user /</strong> As a gamer, working on a product used by gamers
                                helped create a strong sense of user empathy. Even if you might not
                                be a part of your product's target audience, understanding the user is crucial to
                                building a compelling experience. As designers, it's our job to make products that
                                solve problems in ways that feel natural.
                            </li>
